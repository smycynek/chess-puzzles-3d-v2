# Chess Puzzles 3d (v2)
Copyright 2022 Steven Mycynek

## Basics
This is my first major rewrite of the chess-puzzles 3d site at
This is my first major rewrite of the older "Chess-puzzles 3d" site at
https://stevenvictor.net/chessGL/

The older site was written in raw WebGL with all shading math done by hand.
This new site uses ThreeJs.

It takes data from chess puzzles generated from
https://stevenvictor.net/chess and renders them in WebGL
using `.gltf` models created in https://cad.onshape.com

Aside from nicer shading, it supports textures, tilt/zoom, and animation.

## Usage
`npm install` and...

`.\prep.sh` -- build and zip for deployment

`.\run` -- run locally
